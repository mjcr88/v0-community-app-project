# Official Announcements

The Announcements section of your dashboard is where property management, HOA boards, or building administration will post important, official information. Unlike standard community posts or event discussions, these are one-way broadcast messages meant to keep you informed about what's happening in your community.

## Viewing Announcements

Important communications appear directly on your main dashboard in the **"Official Announcements"** widget.

- Unread announcements will have a visual indicator to grab your attention.
- Clicking on an announcement card will open its full details, marking it as "Read".
- Some announcements may include a location pin or be linked directly to an upcoming community Event.

### Priority Levels

Pay attention to the color-coded priority badges on announcements:
- **Gray (Normal):** Standard updates, newsletters, or policy reminders.
- **Orange (Important):** Time-sensitive information, such as scheduled water shutoffs or facility closures.
- **Red (Urgent):** Critical alerts, emergency notices, or severe weather warnings.

## The Archives

Administrators often set an announcements to "Auto-Archive" after a certain date (for example, a notice about road paving will disappear the day after the paving is complete).

If you need to find an older announcement:
1. Navigate to your community **Dashboard**.
2. Click on the **"Official"** tab in the navigation menu.
3. Switch from the "Active" view to the **"Archived"** view to search through past communications.

## Targeted Communications

You will only see announcements that are relevant to you. Administrators have the ability to send announcements to the entire community, or restrict them only to specific neighborhoods or buildings. If an announcement doesn't affect your home's location, it won't clutter your feed.
