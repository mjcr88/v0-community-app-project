# Requirements: Admin-Mediated Password Reset

## Problem Statement
The application currently lacks a way for users to reset their passwords if they forget them. Since the system does not have automated email or SMS services configured for the current alpha phase, a manual, admin-mediated process is required to ensure users can regain access to their accounts securely.

## User Persona
- **Resident**: A user who has an existing account but has lost their password.
- **Admin**: A community manager or super admin who facilitates the password reset process.

## Context
Existing authentication is handled via Supabase. The system already has an "Invitation" mechanism that uses unique tokens to allow users to set their initial passwords. This project aims to adapt that pattern for password recovery.

## User Stories
- **RS-1**: As a Resident, I want to request a password reset from the login screen so that I can notify an admin that I've lost access.
- **RS-2**: As an Admin, I want to receive a notification when a resident requests a password reset so that I can take action promptly.
- **RS-3**: As an Admin, I want to generate a secure, one-time-use link for a specific resident that allows them to set a new password.
- **RS-4**: As a Resident, I want to use the link provided by my admin to securely set a new password and log back in.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Request Flow**:
    - The login screen shall include a "Forgot Password?" link.
    - Clicking the link shall open a form requesting the user's email.
    - Upon submission, the system shall verify if a resident with that email exists.
    - If the user exists, the system shall create a "Password Reset Request" (likely a new record in `resident_requests` or a specific notification).
    - The user shall receive a confirmation message: "Request sent. Your admin has been notified. They will contact you with a reset link."
2.  **Admin Flow**:
    - Admins shall see password reset requests in their dashboard/requests area.
    - Admins shall have a button (e.g., in the Resident's edit form or the request details) to "Generate Reset Link".
    - Generating the link shall create a unique, time-limited token associated with the user's account.
    - The system shall display the reset link for the admin to copy and share manually.
3.  **Reset Flow**:
    - The reset link shall direct the user to a dedicated password reset page (`/t/[slug]/password-reset/[token]`).
    - The page shall validate the token's existence and expiration.
    - If valid, the user shall be presented with "New Password" and "Confirm Password" fields.
    - Upon successful reset, the user's password in Supabase Auth shall be updated, the token invalidated, and the user redirected to the login page.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Tokens must be securely generated (UUID) and stored. Reset tokens must expire after a configurable period (e.g., 24 hours).
- **Audit**: Admin actions related to generating reset links should be logged if possible.

## Dependencies
- **Supabase Auth**: Required for password updates via the Admin API (`service_role`).
- **Resident Requests**: Potential integration with the existing requests/notifications system.

## Documentation Gaps
- Missing official authentication flow documentation.
- Missing Admin and Resident guides for manual password recovery.
- Migration required for storing reset tokens or reusing `invite_token`.

## Technical Options

### Option 1: Minimalist (Reuse Existing Schema)
- **Mechanism**: Reuse `users.invite_token` and `users.invited_at` for password resets.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Request**: User submits email on Login -> Create `resident_request` record.
    - **Admin**: Admin clicks "Reset" -> Server action generates UUID in `users.invite_token`.
    - **Reset**: landing page validates `invite_token` and uses Support Role to update password.
- **Pros**:
    - Fast implementation (2-3 hours).
    - Zero database migrations.
    - Leverages existing "Invite" link UI patterns.
- **Cons**:
    - Semantic debt (reusing "invite" for "reset").
    - Cannot distinguish between an active invite and an active reset request in the DB.
- **Effort**: Low (S)

### Option 2: Clean Separation (Dedicated Schema)
- **Mechanism**: Add `reset_token` and `reset_token_expires_at` to the `users` table via migration.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Request**: Same as Option 1.
    - **Admin**: Server action updates the dedicated reset fields.
    - **Reset**: Dedicated logic that checks the specific reset fields and expiry time.
- **Pros**:
    - Architecturally clean; no conflicts with the onboarding flow.
    - Explicit expiration control (e.g., reset links expire in 4 hours vs 24 hours for invites).
- **Cons**:
    - Requires database migration.
    - Slightly more boilerplate in server actions.
- **Effort**: Medium (M)

### Option 3: Ephemeral Request Tokens
- **Mechanism**: Store the reset token within the `resident_requests` table metadata.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Request**: Create `resident_request` with a `token` field in the payload.
    - **Admin**: Admin "approves" the request, which activates the token already in the request record.
    - **Reset**: Validation queries the `resident_requests` table directly.
- **Pros**:
    - Keeps the `users` table strictly for profile/auth state.
    - Perfect audit trail (the token is tied to the request record).
- **Cons**:
    - Diverges from the existing pattern where tokens are on the `users` table.
    - Slightly more complex verification queries.
- **Effort**: Medium (M)


## Recommendation

### Selected Solution: Option 4 (Secure Private Table)
Following the **Technical Review (Phase 1)**, the initial recommendation of Option 2 (adding tokens to `public.users`) was deemed a **Critical Security Risk** due to RLS policies exposing user data to the user themselves (risk of session hijacking).

**New Recommendation**: Implement a **Dedicated Private Table** (`private.password_resets`) that is NOT exposed via the public API or RLS. All interactions must occur via `security definer` Server Actions.

## 8. Technical Review

### Phase 0: Issue Details
- **Title**: [Brainstorm] Password Reset Feature
- **Original ID**: 152669783
- **Extraction Date**: 2026-01-29

### Phase 0: Impact Map
- **Frontend**: `app/t/[slug]/login/login-form.tsx` (Needs UI update for "Forgot Password")
- **Backend**: 
  - New DB columns/table for reset tokens.
  - New Server Actions for requesting/generating resets.
  - Integration with `app/actions/resident-requests.ts` if using the generic request system.
- **Dependencies**: Supabase Auth, `resident_requests` table.

### Phase 0: Historical Context
- **Login Module**: Deeply refactored ~Jan 16 (Commit `3dfa31c`) to improve UX and remove auto-login.
- **Request Module**: `resident-requests.ts` handles creation/updates.

### Phase 1: Security Audit
- **Vibe Check**: 
  - ⚠️ **Critical Risk**: The recommendation to add `reset_token` to `public.users` is dangerous. The `users_select_own` policy makes all columns visible to the authenticated user. If a session is hijacked, the attacker could read a newly generated reset token if it exists.
  - **Recommendation**: Create a dedicated `password_resets` table with NO public RLS access (only accessible via Security Definer functions) or use a hashed token approach.
- **Attack Surface**:
  - **Enumeration**: Request endpoint must not reveal if an email exists (always say "If account exists, request sent").
  - **Spam**: `createResidentRequest` needs rate limiting to prevent flooding admins.
  - **Token Handling**: Tokens should be short-lived (e.g., 1 hour) and invalidated after use.

### Phase 2: Test Strategy
- **Sad Paths**:
  - Request pending while another exists (Debounce/Throttle).
  - Invalid/Expired Token usage.
  - Admin attempting to reset Super Admin (Role hierarchy check).
- **Test Plan**:
  - **Unit**: Token generation (ensure high entropy), Expiry validation logic.
  - **Integration**: `requestPasswordReset` creates `resident_request`. `verifyRecoveryToken` validates hash.
  - **E2E**: Full flow: Request -> Admin Generate -> Reset -> Login.

### Phase 3: Performance Assessment
- **Schema Impact**: Low. New table `private.password_resets` is minimal.
- **Query Impact**: Requests are low frequency. Index on `token_hash` required.

### Phase 4: Documentation Plan
- **Manuals**:
  - Update `resident-guide.md`: "How to recover access".
  - Update `admin-guide.md`: "Processing Password Reset Requests".
- **Technical**:
  - New `docs/02-technical/flows/auth/password-reset.md`.
  - Update `docs/02-technical/schema/tables/resident_requests.md` (new request type).

### Phase 5: Strategic Alignment
- **Decision**: **Prioritize**. Critical missing feature for self-service/low-admin-overhead management.
- **Sizing**: **Medium** (requires new secure schema, admin UI, and public pages).

## 9. Specification (Consolidated)

### Database Schema
Create a new table `private.password_resets` (not exposed via API):
```sql
create table private.password_resets (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references public.users(id) not null,
  token_hash text not null,
  expires_at timestamptz not null,
  consumed_at timestamptz,
  created_by uuid references public.users(id), -- Admin who generated it
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Workflow
1.  **Resident Request**: User submits email on Login page.
    - System checks `users` table (internal function).
    - If found, creates `resident_requests` entry (Type: `password_reset`).
    - UI shows "If an account exists, a request has been sent."
2.  **Admin Action**:
    - Admin sees request in Dashboard.
    - Clicks "Generate Recovery Link".
    - System generates high-entropy token, hashes it -> `private.password_resets`.
    - Returns link: `https://app.nido.com/auth/reset?token=...`
3.  **Recovery**:
    - Resident clicks link.
    - Server verifies hash & expiry.
    - If valid, allow `updateUser` password change.
    - Mark token `consumed`.
