- **Board Status**: Issue moved to "In Progress".
- **Patterns**:
    - [To be filled after reading patterns]

## Clarifications (Socratic Gate)
- **Legacy Data**: Confirmed no migration needed for existing geometries. Current data volume: ~460 lots, ~6 facilities.
- **Color Workflow**: Confirmed "Set Default on Import + Edit Individually Later".
- **Geometry Type**: Heterogeneous types supported. Parser MUST NOT aggressively merge disconnected LineStrings into Polygons.
- **Regression**: Explicit requirement to test re-upload of old files to ensure zero regressions.
- **Elevation**: Confirmed requirement to calculate and auto-populate `elevation_gain` from Z-coordinates.

## Progress Log
- **2026-02-05 17:58**: [Phase 1 Update] Added `elevation_gain` and `path_length` to schema and parser logic per User request.
- **2026-02-05 17:50**: Initialized Worklog. Switched to branch `feat/83-geojson-upload`.
- **2026-02-05 18:00**: [Phase 1] Analysis Complete.
    - Identified incorrect behavior in `lib/geojson-parser.ts` (merging all LineStrings).
    - Identified Z-coord stripping in `lib/coordinate-transformer.ts`.
    - Identified Schema definition: `locations` uses 3 separate columns (`coordinates`, `boundary_coordinates`, `path_coordinates`).
    - Plan updated with Agent assignments.
- **2026-02-05 18:30**: [Phase 2] Data Persistence Fixes.
    - Fixed MapboxEditorClient to persist custom color on manual edits.
    - Fixed GeoJSON Preview Map to handle Elevation/Length correctly.
    - Updated `createLocation/updateLocation` Server Actions to handle Type mismatch (String vs Number) for stats.
- **2026-02-05 19:30**: [Phase 2] UI Polish & Bug Fixes.
    - Fixed `valid_path_surface` check constraint violation by mapping "Mixed" -> "Natural".
    - Fixed "Hard" -> "Difficult" mapping.
    - Capitalized "Difficulty" display in Resident View.
- **2026-02-06 12:00**: [QA Start] Triggered /run_qa workflow.
    - **Phase 0 (Code Analysis)**: No PR found. Manual diff verification initiated.
    - **Phase 1 (Test Readiness)**: 
        - E2E Tests: No (Coverage Gap).
        - Unit Tests: Missing `lib/geojson-parser.test.ts` (Coverage Gap).
        - **Critical**: Test Suite is effectively empty for this feature.
    - **Phase 2 (Security)**: 
        - RLS: Verified `locations` policies (Tenant Isolation + Role Access) - PASS.
        - Scan: Security Scan passed. Lint Check FAILED.
    - **Phase 3 (Docs & Release)**:
        - Doc Audit: `docs/02-technical/schema/tables/locations.md` needs finding.
        - **Proposed Release Note**:
            > 🚀 **[GeoJSON & Map Color]**
            > 🗺️ **[Feature] Reliable Map Import**
            > Admins can now upload GeoJSON files with confidence! We've fixed the "merged paths" bug and now preserve elevation data (Z-axis) for accurate walking path stats.
            >
            > 🎨 **[Style] Map Color Customization**
            > You can now set custom colors for each location! Differentiate "Walking Paths" from "Property Lines" directly in the Map Editor.


## Handovers
<!-- Agent-to-Agent context transfers -->

## Blockers & Errors
- **Constraint Violation (`valid_path_surface`)**: The database has a strict CHECK constraint allowing only `['paved', 'gravel', 'dirt', 'natural']`. The UI was submitting "Mixed", causing 500 errors.
- **Type Mismatch (`path_length`)**: The `locations` table schema defines `path_length` and `elevation_gain` as `text` (legacy reason). The App was sending `number`, causing runtime errors in the Server Action which expected `number`.
- **Stale Resident Data**: Updates made in the Admin Dashboard were not reflecting in the Resident View because the Next.js App Router was caching the `GET /api/locations` route.
- **"Hard" vs "Difficult"**: UI dropdown had "Hard", DB constraint required "Difficult".
- **Unwanted Admin UI**: "Edit Map Data" and "Export GeoJSON" buttons appeared in legend but were non-functional.

## Decisions
- **Color Consistency**: We standardized on **Green (`#4ade80`)** for Lots and **Yellow (`#eab308`)** for Streets across _both_ Admin and Resident views. We reverted the "Asparagus Green" Admin preference to avoid maintaining two color systems.
- **Dynamic API**: We added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to the Resident API route to ensure real-time data accuracy, accepting the minor performance trade-off for data correctness.
- **Constraint Mapping**: Instead of altering the Database Constraint (which is risky/complex), we updated the UI map "Mixed" to "Natural" and "Hard" to "Difficult".
- **Text vs Number**: We updated the Server Action types to accept `string | number` but cast to `string` before saving, respecting the existing legacy schema rather than attempting a risky column type migration.

## Lessons Learned
- **DB Constraints > UI Options**: When using strict Postgres `CHECK` constraints, the Frontend validation/options must be _identical_ to the DB allowed values. Always check `information_schema.check_constraints` when adding new dropdowns.
- **Server Action Types**: TypeScript types in Server Actions should be loose enough to accept Client data (`number` from input) but strict enough to satisfy the DB (cast to `string` if Column is Text).
- **Cache Invalidation**: For "Live" dashboards, always explicitly set `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or use `revalidatePath` on the Server Action. Default Next.js caching is too aggressive for admin-driven content.
