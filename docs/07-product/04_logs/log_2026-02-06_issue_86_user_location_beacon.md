# Build Log: User Location Beacon (Live Blue Dot)
**Issue:** #86 | **Date:** 2026-02-06 | **Status:** Done

## Context
- **PRD Link**: [prd_2026-02-02_sprint_1_security_polish.md](../../03_prds/prd_2026-02-02_sprint_1_security_polish.md)
- **Req Link**: [requirements_2026-02-06_user_location_beacon.md](../../02_requirements/requirements_2026-02-06_user_location_beacon.md)
- **Board Status**: To Do -> In Progress
- **Nido Patterns Checked**:
    - **Mapbox Implementation**: Notes on `MapboxViewer.tsx` lazy loading and z-index gotchas.
    - **Client Component Overuse**: Avoid unnecessary "use client". (Though Mapbox components likely need it).
    - **Mapbox Monolith**: Ensure lazy loading is preserved.

## Clarifications (Socratic Gate)
1. **Permission Denied UX**: Currently uses `alert()`. Should we upgrade to a `sonner` Toast for a better experience?
   - **Answer**: Yes, use Sonner.
2. **Out of Bounds**: If the user is 100km away, should "Find Me" fly to them (ignoring boundary) or show a warning "You are too far"?
   - **Answer**: Fly to them.
3. **Visuals**: Is the standard Mapbox blue dot sufficient, or do we need a custom Nido-branded marker?
   - **Answer**: Standard is sufficient.

## Progress Log
- **2026-02-06**: Initialized Phase 0. Context established. Branch `feat/86-user-location-beacon` created.
- **2026-02-06**: Phase 1 Complete. User confirmed Socratic questions (Sonner + Fly To).
- **2026-02-06**: Phase 2 Complete. Implemented `useGeolocation` and updated `MapboxViewer`. Running verification.
- **2026-02-06**: Phase 3 Verification.
    - `npm run lint` failed (Project Config Issue: Circular JSON in .eslintrc).
    - `npx tsc` run (Completed with unrelated errors).
    - Manual Verification Checklist prepared in `walkthrough.md`.
    - Fixed potential `GeolocationPositionError` constant issue.
- **2026-02-06**: Phase 4 & 5 Complete. User approved. PRD and Patterns updated. Task closed.

## Handovers
- **To QA/User**: Feature is ready for manual verification on `feat/86-user-location-beacon`. Key test cases in `walkthrough.md`.

## Blockers & Errors
- **Lint Config Circular Dependency**: `npm run lint` failed due to a circular reference in `.eslintrc` configurations. Bypassed by using `tsc` for type safety, but the linter config needs a dedicated DevOps fix (out of scope for this feature).
- **Firefox Permission Query**: Noted that `navigator.permissions.query` can fail in Firefox. Handled gracefully in `useGeolocation.ts` by defaulting permission status to "unknown" rather than crashing.

## Decisions
- **Sonner for Errors**: Replaced native `alert()` with `sonner` Toasts to align with design system.
- **Lazy Permission Request**: We do NOT request location on mount. We only request it when the user explicitly clicks "Find Me" to respect user privacy and avoid "permission fatigue".
- **Numeric Error Codes**: Used hardcoded numeric checks (`error.code === 1`) for Geolocation errors to avoid relying on potentially undefined static constants in some distinct browser environments.
- **"Fly To" vs Warning**: Decided to fly the map to the user even if they are far away, rather than blocking them. This gives the user control.

## Lessons Learned
- **Geolocation UX**: Always use a "Lazy Enable" pattern. Never prompt for permissions on page load without user context.
- **Defensive API Coding**: Standard Web APIs (like Geolocation) have edge cases across browsers (Firefox vs Chrome). Always wrap them in defensive hooks that handle "unknown" states.
