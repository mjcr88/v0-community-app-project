# Build Log: Event Series Detachment & RSVP Fix
**Issue:** #78 | **Date:** 2026-02-07 | **Status:** In Progress

## Context
- **PRD Link**: [Sprint 2 PRD](file:///Users/mj/Developer/v0-community-app-project/docs/07-product/03_prds/prd_2026-02-02_sprint_2_ux_polish.md)
- **Req Link**: [Requirements Doc](file:///Users/mj/Developer/v0-community-app-project/docs/07-product/02_requirements/requirements_2026-01-28_upcoming_widget_rsvp_fix.md)
- **Board Status**: Logged as 'In Progress' by User.

## Patterns & Lessons
- **Backend-First**: Enforce server-action logic for cloning.
- **Responsive-First**: Align Series Choice with Issue #93's drawer patterns.

## Verification Plan
**Assigned Agent**: `@[orchestrator]`

## Clarifications (Socratic Gate)
<!-- To be filled in Phase 1 -->

## Proposed Changes

### [Backend] Data Layer & Server Actions
**Assigned Agent**: `@[backend-specialist]`
Modify `lib/data/events.ts` and `app/actions/events.ts` to ensure data consistency and add the detachment capability.

### [Frontend] UI Components
**Assigned Agent**: `@[frontend-specialist]`
Apply fixes to the widget and RSVP action components.

## Progress Log
- **2026-02-07 14:44**: Initialized `feat/78-series-detachment` branch.
- **2026-02-07 14:44**: Created worklog.
## [2026-02-07] Phase 1: Research & Socratic Gate
- **Status**: Completed
- **Findings**:
    - **RSVP Count Mismatch**: Confirmed `UpcomingEventsWidget.tsx` expects `attending_count` but `getEvents` data layer provides `_count.rsvps`.
    - **Detachment Strategy**: Verified that individual occurrences are already separate rows in the `events` table (up to 12). Detachment can be achieved by setting `parent_event_id` to `null`.
    - **API Route**: `/api/events/upcoming/[tenantId]` utilizes `getEvents` with `enrichWithRsvpCount: true`, but mapping to `attending_count` is missing.
- **Socratic Gate Questions**:
    1. Should detached events become strictly one-off instances (clear recurrence rule) or retain a link for reference?
    2. Confirming that RSVPs should persist for a detached occurrence (automatic since they are linked to `event_id`).
    3. UI treatment for "Detached" vs "Series" events in the widget.

## Handovers
- **Phase 0 -> Phase 1**: Environment ready. Handing off for research. (`@[project-planner]` -> `@[project-planner]`)
- **Phase 1 -> Phase 2**: Research complete. Implementation plan approved. (`@[project-planner]` -> `@[project-planner]`)
- **Phase 2 (Implementation)**: `@[backend-specialist]` completed RSVP count aliasing and detachment logic. Refactored `updateEvent` to handle occurrence overrides.
- **Backend -> Frontend Handover**: Data layer now provides `attending_count` alias. Server actions now support individual occurrence detachment. Handing off to `@[frontend-specialist]` for UI verification.
- **Phase 2 (Frontend)**: `@[frontend-specialist]` verified widget count mapping and `EventRsvpQuickAction` compatibility. Components are now correctly consuming `attending_count` and handling series/detached events.
- **Frontend -> Orchestrator Handover**: Implementation complete. Handing off to `@[orchestrator]` for final verification phase.
- **Phase 3 (Verification)**: `@[orchestrator]` auditing `updateEvent` recursion safety and UI mapping.

## [2026-02-07] Phase 3: Verification Checkpoint
- **Status**: Completed
- **Automated Checks**: Passed (Lint/Types).
- **Manual Verification**:
    - [x] **Cross-Card Sync**: Verified `rio-series-rsvp-sync` event bus propagates status instantly between Priority Feed, Widget, and Main List.
    - [x] **Branding**: Verified all RSVP buttons use `primary` (Forest), `secondary` (Sunrise), `destructive` (Clay).
    - [x] **Series Detachment**: Verified "This event only" correctly detaches and updates specific instance.
    - [x] **Optimistic UI**: Verified immediate feedback on click, with background server validation.

## [2026-02-07] Phase 4: User Approval Gate
- **Status**: Approved
- **Demo**: Walkthrough presented to user demonstrating seamless multi-widget sync.

## [2026-02-07] Phase 5: Closeout & Transition
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Documentation**:
    - Added "Event Bus Sync" pattern to `nido_patterns.md`.
    - Updated `walkthrough.md` with final screenshots.
- **Pull Request**: Draft PR created.

## Decisions
- **Event Bus Pattern**: Selected `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('rio-sync'))` for lightweight cross-component communication without Redux/Context overhead for this specific ephemeral state.
- **Optimistic UI**: Enforced optimistic updates for *all* RSVP actions to eliminate perceived latency.

## Lessons Learned
- **Tailwind Colors**: Hardcoded colors (e.g., `bg-green-500`) are tech debt. Always use semantic tokens (`bg-primary`) to support theming (Earth tones/Dark mode).
- **Event Bus**: Great for decoupled widgets, but key is unique naming (`rio-series-rsvp-sync`) to avoid collisions.
