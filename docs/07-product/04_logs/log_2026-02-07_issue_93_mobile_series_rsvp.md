# Build Log: Mobile Series RSVP UI
**Issue:** #93 | **Date:** 2026-02-07 | **Status:** In Progress

## Context
- **PRD Link**: [prd_2026-02-02_sprint_1_security_polish.md](../../03_prds/prd_2026-02-02_sprint_1_security_polish.md)
- **Req Link**: [requirements_2026-02-07_mobile_series_rsvp.md](../../02_requirements/requirements_2026-02-07_mobile_series_rsvp.md)
- **Branch**: `feat/93-mobile-series-rsvp`
- **Goal**: Implement responsive Series RSVP UI (Drawer on Mobile, Dialog on Desktop).

## Clarifications (Socratic Gate)
### Phase 1: Research Findings
- **Dependency**: `vaul` is installed (^0.9.9) but `components/ui/drawer.tsx` is MISSING.
- **Impacted Files**:
    - `components/event-rsvp-quick-action.tsx` (Needs `ResponsiveDialog` wrapper)
    - `app/t/[slug]/dashboard/events/[eventId]/event-rsvp-section.tsx` (Needs `ResponsiveDialog` wrapper)

### Questions for User
1.  **Component Generation**: Since `vaul` is installed but the component is missing, should I generate the standard **shadcn/ui Drawer** component?
2.  **Z-Index & Mobile Dock**: The "Mobile Dock" has caused z-index issues before (see Patterns). Should the RSVP Drawer overlay the dock (z-index > 50)?
3.  **Breakpoint**: Confirming we use standard Tailwind `md` (768px) as the split between Drawer (Mobile) and Dialog (Desktop)?

## Progress Log

## Decisions
- **Responsive Architecture**: Used `ResponsiveDialog` wrapper to handle Mobile (Drawer) vs Desktop (Dialog) split.
- **Drawer Library**: Revived `vaul` drawer component from deprecated library.

## QA: Phase 0 - CodeRabbit Review
**Findings & Action Items**:
1.  **[x] Lint (Major)**: `app/actions/events-series.test.ts` - `noThenProperty` rule violation.
    *   *Action*: Add suppression and rename unused param.
2.  **[x] Performance (Minor)**: `app/actions/events.ts` - Redundant query for RSVP counts.
    *   *Action*: Remove unused `countMap` query.
3.  **[x] Logic (Minor)**: `app/actions/events.ts` - Capacity check blocks updates for existing RSVPs.
    *   *Action*: Exclude current user's RSVP from capacity check.
4.  **[x] Documentation (Minor)**: `requirements_...md` - Heading typo `to`.
    *   *Action*: Fix typo.
5.  **[x] Best Practice (Minor)**: `hooks/use-media-query.ts` - SSR safety check missing.
    *   *Action*: Add `window` check and lazy init.
6.  **[x] Repo Hygiene (Minor)**: `playwright-report/index.html` - Large artifact committed.
    *   *Action*: Delete file and add to `.gitignore`.
7.  **[x] Logic (Major)**: `app/api/dashboard/priority/route.ts` - Ongoing events excluded.
    *   *Action*: Update date filter to include ongoing events.
8.  **Workflow (Minor)**: `.agent/workflows/04_build.md` - Vague git steps.
    *   *Action*: Add concrete commands.
9.  **Testing (Minor)**: `e2e/series-rsvp.spec.ts` - Flaky data dependency.
    *   *Action*: Add data seeding.
10. **[x] Refactor (Nit)**: Rename `showseriesDialog` -> `showSeriesDialog`.
11. **[x] UI (Minor)**: `EventRsvpSection` - Mobile padding missing.
    *   *Action*: Add `px-4`.

## Phase 2: Test Audit
- [ ] Audit `app/actions/events-series.test.ts` coverage.
- [ ] Audit `e2e/series-rsvp.spec.ts` for flakes.

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Gaps
- **Skipped Phase 5 & 6**: Accessibility and Load testing were NOT conducted because the current environment lacks the necessary E2E automation infrastructure for these specific audits.
