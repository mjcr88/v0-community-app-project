# Worklog: Location Validation QA
**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Feature**: Location Conflict Blocking & Filtering
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

## Phase 0: Activation & Code Analysis
- **Branch**: `fix/69-qa-patch`
- **Issue**: Location Filtering & Conflict Detection (#61 / #69)
- **Context**: 
  - Implemented blocking logic for event conflicts.
  - Refactored Location Filter to Searchable Combobox.
  - Fixed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` fallback for local dev.

### Existing Review Feedback (CodeRabbit)
- [x] No PR comments available (Local Check)

## Phase 1: Test Readiness Audit
- [x] E2E Tests: None existed previously, relying on manual verification.
- [x] Unit Tests: Verified via `npm test` earlier (passed).
- [x] Migrations Required: Yes (`20260212000001_add_events_location_date_index.sql`).
- [x] Data Alignment: Adding `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` locally aligns dev with prod capabilities.
- [ ] Coverage Gaps: Formal E2E tests for blocking logic missing.

## Phase 2: Specialized Audit
### Security Findings
- [x] RLS Policies Checked: Confirmed policy allows viewing tenant events. Issue was strictly localized config.
- [ ] Vulnerability Scan: Pending.

### Vibe Code Check
- [x] Cardinal Sins Scan: Passed (No exposed Service Role keys in Client Components).
- **Note**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` used strictly in Server Action (`app/actions/events.ts`), which is safe.

### Performance Stats
- [x] Bundle Size: Checked via `checklist.py`.

## Phase 3: Documentation & Release Planning
### Proposed Release Note
- [x] Draft: Added to `prd_2026-02-02_sprint_2_ux_polish.md`.

### Doc Gaps
- [x] Manuals vs Code: Verified.
