# Build Log: [Brainstorm] Product Tour Update 2026
**Issue:** #117 | **Date:** 2026-02-15 | **Status:** Complete

## Context
- **PRD Link**: [Sprint 3 PRD](docs/07-product/03_prds/prd_2026-02-14_sprint_3_core_polish_friction.md)
- **Req Link**: [Requirements](docs/07-product/02_requirements/requirements_2026-02-15_product_tour_update.md)
- **Board Status**: Issue moved to In Progress.
- **Patterns**: Reviewed `nido_patterns.md`. Relevant patterns included:
    - **No Custom Wrappers**: Use standard Shadcn components.
    - **Client Component Overuse**: Keep "use client" at leaves. Tour cards are likely client components.
    - **Asset Optimization**: Use .webp and priority for early slides.

## Clarifications (Socratic Gate)
- **Q**: Confirm asset PII safety?
- **A**: Confirmed by User.
- **Q**: Icon library choice?
- **A**: Lucide is fine.
- **Q**: Step count assumption (10 steps)?
- **A**: Correct.
- **Q**: `exchange_directory_actual.png` real data?
- **A**: User added images; PII confirmed safe.

## Progress Log
- **2026-02-15**: Initialized build log and feature branch `feat/117-product-tour-update`.
- **2026-02-15**: Implemented updates for Slides 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.
- **2026-02-15**: Addressed user feedback:
    - **Slide 2**: Updated to match Slide 1 style (8 icons + beams).
    - **Slide 3**: Changed title to "February Neighbor Gathering".
    - **Slide 4**: Fixed orbiting circles grouping (4 inner, 3 outer) to show all 7 avatars.
    - **Slide 5**: Updated image to `/artifacts/location_page.png`.
    - **Slide 9**: Confirmed image source.
- **2026-02-15**: Verified changes in browser and closed out task.

## Handovers

## Blockers & Errors
<!-- Issues encountered -->

## Decisions
- **Slide 2 Alignment**: Decided to update Slide 2 (`ThemeToggleCard`) to use the same 8-icon `AnimatedBeam` layout as Slide 1 (`BeamIntroCard`) for visual consistency, instead of the original 6-icon layout.
- **Orbiting Circles**: Split the 7 avatars into two groups (inner 4, outer 3) with different radii and directions to ensure all are visible and not overlapping.

## Lessons Learned
### [2026-02-15] Hardcoded Tour Links
**Type**: Gotcha
**Context**: The "Start Tour" button in `RioWelcomeCard` pointed to `/t/[slug]/tour-test`. When we moved the page to `/t/[slug]/onboarding/tour`, the link broke.
**Fix**: Always grep for usage of temporary route names before deleting/moving them.
**Pattern Candidate**: `nido_patterns.md` candidate for "Route Management".

### [2026-02-15] AnimatedBeam Node Consistency
**Type**: Pattern
**Context**: Slide 1 and Slide 2 used `AnimatedBeam`. Slide 1 had 8 nodes, Slide 2 had 6. This looked jarring.
**Fix**: maintain visual consistency across similar "hub and spoke" visualizations. If detailed node mapping isn't strictly necessary, defaults to symmetric layouts (e.g. 4 on each side) for better balance.
