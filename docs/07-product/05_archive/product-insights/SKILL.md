# Product Insights - The "So What"

This skill closes the loop by analyzing how the product is actually performing. It transforms raw data into actionable iteration.

## 📊 Capability Tiers

| Level | Focus | Key Actions |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Junior** | Reporting | Pulls basic SQL queries; formats weekly KPI dashboards. |
| **Mid-Senior** | Optimization | Identifies "Why" behind metrics; runs A/B test analysis; synthesizes user research. |
| **Executive** | Predictive Strategy | Predicts churn risk; correlates macro trends with product data; defines North Star Metric. |

## 🔍 Insight Frameworks

### 1. Anomalous Pattern Detection
**Purpose**: Catch regressions or viral wins instantly.
**Triggers**:
-   Conversion drop > 2% week-over-week.
-   Page load time spike > 200ms (Core Web Vitals).
-   Sudden influx of support tickets on topic X.

### 2. User Research Synthesis
**Purpose**: Quantify qualitative feedback.
**Process**:
1.  **Ingest**: Transcripts (Sales/Support), Feedback Forms.
2.  **Tag**: Categorize by "Pain Point", "Feature Request", "Bug".
3.  **Rank**: Frequency * Severity.
4.  **Quote**: "The user said: '[Quote]'".

### 3. Predictive Churn Modeling
**Propensity Indicators**:
-   **Usage Frequency**: Logins per week declining.
-   **License Utilization**: < 50% seats used.
-   **Support Sentiment**: Negative tone in last 3 tickets.

## 🔄 Feedback Loops

### A. Post-Release Analysis
**When**: 2 weeks after launch.
**Checklist**:
1.  **Adoption**: % of eligible users who tried it.
2.  **Retention**: % who used it > 3 times.
3.  **Action**:
    -   High Adoption / Low Retention -> **Fix UX Gap**.
    -   Low Adoption / High Retention -> **Fix Discovery/Marketing**.

### B. The "Blame-Free" Post-Mortem
**When**: Missed deadline or major bug.
**Format**:
1.  **Timeline**: What happened?
2.  **Root Cause (5 Whys)**: Why did it happen?
3.  **Corrective Action**: Systemic fix (not "be more careful").
