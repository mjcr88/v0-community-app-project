# Product Strategy - The "Why"

This skill equips agents to define the strategic direction of the product. It moves beyond "what to build" to "why we are building it," using data-driven frameworks to justify investment and align with business goals.

## 📊 Capability Tiers

| Level | Focus | Key Actions |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Junior** | Market Research | Scrapes public data (Product Hunt, Reddit) for sentiment; drafts basic persona profiles. |
| **Mid-Senior** | Roadmap Logic | Converts executive vision into GIST roadmaps; leads Opportunity Solution Tree mapping. |
| **Executive** | Macro Strategy | Defines PLG strategy (pricing/packaging); synthesizes market shifts into long-term value prop. |

## 🧠 Strategic Frameworks

### 1. Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)
**Purpose**: Map desired outcomes to customer pain points and potential solutions. Prevents feature factories.
**Structure**:
1.  **Outcome**: Measurable business goal (e.g., "Increase retention by 10%").
2.  **Opportunity**: Customer need/pain (e.g., "Users can't find export button").
3.  **Solution**: Proposed feature (e.g., "One-click CSV export").
4.  **Experiment**: Test to validate solution (e.g., "Fake door test").

### 2. GIST Planning (Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks)
**Purpose**: Agile roadmapping that reduces planning variations and overhead.
-   **Goals**: "Increase Q2 Revenue" (Strategic)
-   **Ideas**: "Add annual billing" (Hypothesis)
-   **Steps**: "Design mockups" -> "A/B test" (Validation)
-   **Tasks**: "Update Stripe config" (Technical)

### 3. Product-Led Growth (PLG) Strategy
**Purpose**: Minimizing friction to value.
**Checklist**:
-   [ ] **Time to Value (TTV)**: Can a user get value < 5 mins?
-   [ ] **Viral Loops**: Does usage naturally invite others?
-   [ ] **Monetization**: Is pricing aligned with value metric (e.g., per seat vs. usage)?

## 🛠️ Actionable Workflows

### A. Market Intelligence Scan (Junior/Mid)
1.  **Identify Competitors**: List top 5 direct competitors.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Scrape G2, Capterra, Reddit for negative sentiment on competitors.
3.  **Gap Analysis**: Identify 3 features users hate in competitor products.

### B. Roadmap Synthesis (Mid/Senior)
1.  **Input**: Executive Thesis + User Pain Points.
2.  **Process**: Map Pain Points to Thesis using OST.
3.  **Output**: A list of "Opportunities" prioritized by RICE score (see `product-execution` skill).

### C. PLG Audit (Executive)
1.  **Acquisition**: Review sign-up flow friction.
2.  **Activation**: Check "Aha!" moment timing.
3.  **Retention**: Analyze habit-forming loops (Hook Model).
