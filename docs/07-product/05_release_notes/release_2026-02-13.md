# Release v1.1: Security & UX Polish

**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Sprints:** 1 (Security) & 2 (UX Polish)

## 🚀 Top Highlights

### 📅 Smart Series RSVP & Management

Managing recurring events is now effortless.

- **RSVP to All**: Join an entire series (e.g., "Weekly Yoga") with one click.
- **Smart Detachment**: Editing a single event in a series (e.g., "Yoga - Special Guest") now correctly creates a standalone event while keeping the rest of the series intact.
- **Priority Feed**: Your dashboard feed is now noise-free, showing only events you've RSVP'd to or saved, plus upcoming series instances.

### 🗺️ Live Map Experience

- **User Location Beacon**: A new "Blue Dot" shows your live location on the community map. Use the "Find Me" button to instantly center your view.
- **Custom Map Colors**: Admins can now assign distinct colors to different map paths (e.g., Blue for Water, Green for Trails) during GeoJSON import.
- **Elevation Data**: Walking paths now display elevation and difficulty data derived from reliable 3D coordinates.

### 🛡️ Admin & Security Hardening

- **Smart Family Selection**: When adding residents, the system now intelligently groups them into existing families on the lot, preventing duplicate households.
- **PII Protection**: Neighbor contact details are now filtered strictly on the server, ensuring private data never reaches the client browser.
- **Auto-Logout**: Added a 2-hour idle timeout for enhanced security, with an optional "Remember Me" for trusted devices.
- **Supabase Dev Environment**: Established a fully isolated `v0-dev` environment to safely test dangerous changes without risking production data.

## ✨ Full Changelog

### 📅 Events & Calendar

- **Feature**: **RSVP to Series**
  A new streamlined modal allows you to RSVP to "This Event Only" or "This and All Future Events" in a series, making it easier to commit to recurring activities like weekly fitness classes.
- **Feature**: **Location Conflict Detection**
  Admins now receive an immediate warning if they attempt to book a space that is already occupied by another event at the same time, preventing double-bookings.
- **Feature**: **Location Filter**
  A new dashboard filter allows residents to quickly find all events happening at a specific venue, such as the "Community Center" or "Poolside".
- **Fix**: **Accurate Widget Counts**
  The "Upcoming Events" widget now correctly calculates attendee numbers for individual occurrences of a series, rather than showing a generic series-wide count.

### 👥 Residents & Directory

- **Feature**: **Smart Family Link**
  When admins add a new resident to a lot, the system now automatically detects existing families on that property and offers to link them, keeping household data clean and organized.
- **Improvement**: **Real-Time Check-In Sync**
  Marking yourself as "Going" or "Checked In" now instantly updates across the Dashboard, Priority Feed, and Map view without needing to refresh the page.
- **Fix**: **Directory Tab Alignment**
  Resolved a visual issue where tabs in the Neighbor Directory were misaligned on desktop screens. The new grid layout ensures perfect symmetry and better touch targets on mobile.
- **Fix**: **Search Reliability**
  Improved the resident search function to correctly handle partial names and case sensitivity, ensuring you can find neighbors even if you only remember part of their name.

### 🗺️ Interactive Map

- **Feature**: **User Location Beacon**
  A new "Blue Dot" indicator shows your real-time location on the community map. Click the "Find Me" button to instantly center the view on yourself, making navigation easier.
- **Feature**: **Custom Map Colors**
  Admins can now assign specific colors to different paths and zones (e.g., blue for streams, green for trails) when uploading GeoJSON data, improving map readability.
- **Fix**: **Reliable GeoJSON Import**
  Fixed an issue where uploading complex map data (like trails) would merge separate paths into a single shape. Imports now strictly preserve the original geometry and elevation data.

### ⚙️ Technical & Infra

- **Infra**: **Dev/Prod Separation**
  We have established a fully isolated `v0-community-dev` environment. This allows our engineering team to safely test complex changes and run migrations without any risk to live production data.
- **Security**: **RLS Recursion Fix**
  Consolidated Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `users` table to prevent a potential "infinite recursion" error, ensuring faster and more reliable access control.
- **Performance**: **Faster Filtering**
  Added new composite database indexes to the `events` table, significantly speeding up queries when filtering by location or date range.
