# WP7: Tone of Voice Guide
## Ecovilla Community Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: November 2024  
**Status**: Foundation established with 3 components, evolving with platform

---

## Voice & Personality

### **The Ecovilla Voice**

Ecovilla sounds like a **warm neighbor who's really good at organizing things**. We're:
- **70% Warm & Welcoming** - Friendly, approachable, personal
- **30% Helpful Guide** - Clear, supportive, practical
- **+10% Playful** - Light moments with Río (context-appropriate)

**Not**: Corporate, stuffy, overly formal, pushy, or treating users like children

---

## Core Principles

### **1. Context-Aware Copy**

Copy adapts based on:
- **What screen?** (Login vs Dashboard vs Error)
- **What emotion?** (Stressed, excited, confused, calm)
- **Which persona?** (Sofia, Marcus, Elena, Carmen)
- **What moment?** (First time, returning, celebrating, struggling)

**Example - Same Action, Different Contexts:**

| Context | Copy |
|---------|------|
| **First event created** | "Your first event! 🎉 Río is excited to see the community gather" |
| **Regular event created** | "Event created! Your neighbors will see it on the calendar" |
| **Error creating event** | "Couldn't create the event. Check your connection and try again?" |

---

### **2. Community-Focused Language**

We weave community naturally into copy without forcing it:

**✅ Do:**
- "Your neighbors are gathering tomorrow"
- "3 residents attending"
- "Share with your community"
- "Welcome to Ecovilla San Mateo"

**❌ Don't:**
- "Your community members are gathering" (awkward)
- "Community residents attending" (redundant)
- "Share with your Ecovilla community members" (wordy)
- "Welcome to the Ecovilla San Mateo intentional community platform" (exhausting)

**Use:**
- "Neighbors" over "users" or "members"
- "Residents" over "accounts" or "profiles"
- "Community" naturally, not forcefully
- "Gathering" or "get-together" over "meeting"

---

### **3. User-Focused Voice**

**Primary:** You/Your (user-focused)  
**Secondary:** We/Us (partnership moments)  
**Avoid:** Platform-centric or third-person

**✅ Examples:**
- "Your events" (ownership)
- "You have 3 new announcements" (direct)
- "We're here to help" (partnership, rare)
- "Let's get you set up" (onboarding, rare)

**❌ Avoid:**
- "User events" (technical)
- "The system has 3 announcements" (robotic)
- "Platform functionality includes..." (corporate)

---

### **4. Formality Level: Very Casual (but Clear)**

We're friendly neighbors, not business colleagues or party hosts.

**Spectrum:**
```
Too Casual          ✓ Sweet Spot          Too Formal
"Hey! 👋"            "Hi Sofia!"            "Greetings."
"Oops!"              "Hmm, that didn't     "Error occurred."
                     work"
"You're crushing    "Nice! You're all      "Configuration 
it!"                 set"                   complete."
```

**Guidelines:**
- Contractions: Yes! (you're, we're, didn't, can't)
- Hey/Hi: Yes, but skip overenthusiastic punctuation (No "Hey there!!!")
- Casual phrases: "Hmm", "Nice", "All set" ✓
- Slang: No (no "dope", "lit", "epic" unless it's genuinely community language)
- Professional when serious: Yes (errors, security, account deletion)

---

### **5. Emojis: Sparingly & Purposefully**

**Use emojis for:**
- ✅ Celebrations: "Event created! 🎉"
- ✅ Welcomes: "Welcome back, Sofia! ☀️"
- ✅ Empty states: Combined with Río illustrations
- ✅ Success moments: "You're all set! ✨"

**Don't use emojis for:**
- ❌ Navigation labels: "Events" not "📅 Events"
- ❌ Error messages: Keep these clear
- ❌ Every sentence: Dilutes impact
- ❌ Professional contexts: Account security, deletions

**Emoji Personality:**
- Warm: ☀️ 🌱 ✨ 🎉 
- Avoid: 🔥 💯 👏 (too trendy)
- Nature-themed when possible (aligns with Ecovilla)

---

## Río the Sloth: Occasional Voice

### **When Río Appears**

Río shows up in **5-10% of copy interactions**:

**Prime Moments:**
1. **Empty States** - Encouraging users with personality
2. **Onboarding** - First impressions and guidance
3. **Celebrations** - Big achievements (first event, profile complete)
4. **All Caught Up** - Nothing left to do (Río sleeping)
5. **Gentle Nudges** - Suggestions, not nagging

**Not appearing:**
- Regular buttons and labels
- Navigation
- Form fields
- Most success/error messages
- Professional/serious contexts

---

### **Río's Personality**

**Río is:**
- Laid-back but not lazy
- Encouraging but not pushy
- Wise but not preachy
- Playful but knows when to be quiet
- Costa Rican spirit: "Pura vida" energy

**Río says things like:**
- "Take your time, there's no rush" (slow living philosophy)
- "Your community will love this!" (encouraging)
- "Río is excited to see neighbors gathering" (third-person, humble)
- "Nothing here yet? Time to change that!" (playful nudge)

**Río doesn't:**
- Speak in first person ("I think...")
- Give commands ("You must...")
- Appear in errors or serious moments
- Overexplain or lecture
- Use slang or try too hard to be cool

---

### **Río in Empty States**

**Formula:** Río Illustration + Context + Encouragement + Clear CTA

**Examples:**

```
[Río looking at empty calendar]

No events yet

Time to bring your neighbors together! 
Río can't wait to see what you plan.

[Create Your First Event]
```

```
[Río sleeping peacefully]

All caught up! 

You've seen everything new. 
Río is taking a siesta too. ☀️

[Browse Residents] [Check Map]
```

```
[Río waving goodbye]

See you soon!

Río hopes you had a great time 
connecting with your community.

## Copy Patterns by Type

### **Headings**

**Page Titles:**
- Clear, direct nouns: "Events", "Dashboard", "Map"
- Never questions: Not "What's happening?"
- Context when helpful: "Your Profile", "Community Events"

**Section Headings:**
- Action-oriented when appropriate: "Upcoming Gatherings"
- Descriptive: "Recent Announcements", "Active Residents"
- Keep short: 2-4 words ideal

**Empty State Headings:**
- Simple statement: "No events yet"
- Avoid negativity: Not "You have no friends" (use "No connections yet")
- Sometimes playful: "The calendar is lonely"

---

### **Buttons & CTAs**

**Formula:** [Verb] + [Benefit/Object]

**Primary Actions:**
- "Create Event" (direct)
- "Join Gathering" (inviting)
- "Connect with Neighbors" (benefit-oriented)
- "Start Building Your Profile" (personal)
- "Explore the Community" (inviting)

**Secondary Actions:**
- "Learn More"
- "Maybe Later"
- "Skip for Now"
- "Go Back"

**Destructive Actions:**
- "Yes, Delete" (confirm explicitly)
- "Remove Event" (clear consequence)
- Never just "OK" for destructive actions

---

### **Success Messages**

**Formula:** [Celebration] + [Confirmation] + [Optional: Next Step]

**Big Wins (Celebratory + Next Step):**
- "Event created! 🎉 Your neighbors will see it on the calendar"
- "Profile complete! ✨ Ready to explore your community?"
- "First check-in! Nice! Your neighbors know where to find you"

**Regular Actions (Confirmational + Next Step):**
- "Event updated. Changes are live"
- "Request submitted. We'll notify you when it's reviewed"
- "Profile saved. Looking good!"

**Minor Actions (Simple Confirmation):**
- "Saved"
- "Done"
- "Updated"

**Toast Duration:**
- Celebratory: 4 seconds (time to read and feel good)
- Regular: 3 seconds
- Minor: 2 seconds

---

### **Error Messages**

**Formula:** [What Happened] + [Why/Context] + [Solution]

**Network Errors:**
- "Couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again?"
- "Can't load events right now. Are you online?"

**Validation Errors:**
- "That email is already in use. Want to log in instead?"
- "Please enter a valid email address"
- "Event needs a title and date to continue"

**Permission Errors:**
- "You don't have permission to do that. Contact your admin?"
- "This content isn't available to you"

**Generic Errors:**
- "Hmm, that didn't work. Try again?"
- "Something went wrong. We're looking into it"

**Never:**
- Technical jargon: "Error 500", "Null pointer exception"
- Blame users: "You entered invalid data"
- Dead ends: "Error occurred" with no solution
- ALL CAPS: "ERROR!"

---

### **Empty States**

**Formula:** [Río Illustration] + [Heading] + [Context/Encouragement] + [CTA]

**Encouraging & Playful:**

```
[Río looking hopeful]
No neighbors yet

You're one of the first! 
Río can't wait to meet the community.

[Invite Residents]
```

```
[Río with magnifying glass]
No results found

Try adjusting your search?
Río is still looking!

[Clear Filters]
```

**Context-Aware:**

First-time user:
```
[Río waving]
Welcome to your map!

This is where you'll see community locations.
Let's add your first one!

[Add Location]
```

Returning user with no content:
```
[Río relaxing]
All quiet here

Create an event to bring neighbors together?

[Create Event] [Browse Events]
```

---

### **Loading States**

**Short Waits (< 2 seconds):**
- Spinner only, no text
- Or: Simple present tense: "Loading..."

**Medium Waits (2-5 seconds):**
- "Loading your events..."
- "Getting things ready..."
- "Checking with the community..."

**Long Waits (> 5 seconds):**
- Río animation + text
- "Río is gathering information..."
- "This might take a moment..."
- "Almost there..."

**Never:**
- Percentages (unless truly accurate): Not "Loading 47%"
- Time estimates if uncertain: Not "30 seconds remaining" (unless sure)
- Anxiety-inducing: Not "Please wait, do not close window"

---

### **Confirmations**

**Destructive Actions:**
- "Delete this event? This can't be undone."
- "Remove Sofia from your family? You can add her back later."
- "Leave this gathering? Neighbors are counting on you."

**Non-Destructive:**
- "Leave without saving changes?"
- "Cancel this request? You can create a new one anytime."

**Buttons:**
- Destructive: "Yes, Delete" + "Cancel" (default)
- Non-destructive: "Yes, Leave" + "Keep Editing" (default)

---

### **Microcopy & Helper Text**

**Form Field Helpers:**
- Be specific: "Your email for login and notifications"
- Set expectations: "Visible to all community members"
- Not obvious: Skip "Enter your name" (the label says "Name")

**Tooltips:**
- Brief: 5-10 words max
- Actually helpful: Not "This is a button"
- Contextual: "This will notify all residents"

**Placeholders:**
- Examples: "your@email.com" not "Email address"
- Helpful: "e.g., Yoga in the garden"
- Never instructions: Not "Type your password here"

**Character Counts:**
- Positive: "23 characters remaining"
- Not negative: Not "523 characters over limit" (show at 0)

---

## Writing for Context

### **High-Stress Moments**

**When:** Errors, urgent requests, account issues

**Voice:** Professional, clear, calm, solution-focused

**Do:**
- Be direct
- Offer clear solutions
- Show empathy without over-apologizing
- Provide support contact

**Don't:**
- Add personality (no Río, no emojis)
- Be casual or flip
- Hide behind jargon
- Blame anyone

**Example:**
```
Couldn't process your request

This might be a temporary issue. 
Try again in a few minutes?

If this keeps happening, contact support.

[Try Again] [Contact Support]
```

---

### **Celebration Moments**

**When:** Achievements, first-time actions, milestones

**Voice:** Warm, celebratory, next-step oriented

**Do:**
- Celebrate genuinely
- Use emojis
- Suggest next action
- Maybe include Río

**Example:**
```
[Río celebrating]

Profile complete! ✨

Río thinks you're ready to explore the community. 
Want to browse your neighbors?

[Meet Your Neighbors] [Maybe Later]
```

---

### **Onboarding**

**When:** First login, feature discovery, tutorials

**Voice:** Welcoming, patient, clear, encouraging

**Do:**
- Welcome warmly
- Set expectations
- Make it optional
- Use Río for personality

**Example:**
```
[Río waving]

Welcome to Ecovilla San Mateo! ☀️

Río is here to help you get settled. 
We'll start with the basics—your profile, 
finding neighbors, and exploring the map.

Ready to begin?

[Let's Go!] [Skip Tour]
```

---

### **Routine Actions**

**When:** Daily usage, familiar tasks

**Voice:** Efficient, clear, minimal

**Do:**
- Be brief
- Skip obvious explanations
- Maintain warmth but don't overdo it

**Example:**
```
Event created

Neighbors will see it on the calendar.

[View Calendar]
```

---

## Grammar & Style Rules

### **Spelling & Capitalization**

- **US English** (organization, color, neighbor)
- **Sentence case** for headings: "Your profile" not "Your Profile"
- **Title Case** only for proper nouns: "Ecovilla San Mateo"
- **Capitalize**: UI elements when referring to them: "Click the Create button"

---

### **Punctuation**

- **Periods**: Use in paragraphs, skip in single-line UI text
- **Exclamation marks**: Celebrations only (1 per message max)
- **Question marks**: When genuinely asking (not rhetorical questions)
- **Ellipsis**: Loading states only ("Loading...")
- **Colons**: Introduce lists or explanations

**Examples:**
```
✅ Welcome back, Sofia! (greeting)
✅ Event created (confirmation, no period)
✅ Want to learn more? (genuine question)
✅ Loading your events... (in progress)
❌ Check out the new features!!! (too many)
❌ You created an event. (period unnecessary)
```

---

### **Numbers**

- **Spell out**: One to nine
- **Numerals**: 10+, dates, times, counts
- **Always numerals**: Stats, badges, technical specs

**Examples:**
- "three announcements" (small)
- "15 residents attending" (larger)
- "2 hours ago" (time)
- "42 active residents" (stat)

---

### **Dates & Times**

- **Relative**: Recent actions ("2 hours ago", "yesterday")
- **Absolute**: Future events ("Nov 21, 2024", "Tomorrow at 10am")
- **Format**: Month DD, YYYY or "Tomorrow/Today"
- **Time**: 12-hour with am/pm ("2:30pm")

---

### **Contractions**

**Use freely** - Makes copy conversational:
- you're, we're, can't, didn't, it's, that's, here's, there's

**Exception**: Avoid in critical moments (security, legal)

---
